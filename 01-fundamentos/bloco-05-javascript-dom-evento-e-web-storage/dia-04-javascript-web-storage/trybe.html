      <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
      <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. <br />
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
        1500s, <br />
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
        type specimen book. <br />
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, <br />
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
        the release of Letraset <br />
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
        publishing software <br />
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

      <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
      <p>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by <br />
        the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. <br />
        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
        <br />
        distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
        <br />
        here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
        <br />
        packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
        <br />
        text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still
        <br />
        in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
        sometimes <br />
        by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). <br />
